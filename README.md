## [UNIX rules for life](https://stormrider.io/rules/)

* Keep it simple: It's cheaper and easier to carry around.
* Do one thing at a time: Multitasking is a lie.
* Network: You were born to connect.
* Say what you mean; nothing is truer than the truth.
* Hack: Trial and error is the only way we learn anything
* Be who you are: Even a bent wire can carry a great light.
* Use leverage; a bigger hammer isn't always the answer.
* Use what you have: never dig diamonds with a brick of gold.
* Have faith; all's possible, except maybe skiing through a revolving door.
* Think ahead, but don't worship your plans; remember today is the first day of the rest of your learning experience.
